/**
 * At most one loaded prover in the process at a time, released when the
 * host says so.
 *
 * A decompressed Longfellow circuit is ~110 MB and a Vega prover key
 * ~140-160 MB, held as native memory outside the Java heap. Each proof
 * system used to keep every prover it had ever loaded in a map for the life
 * of the process, so two proof systems and two attribute counts could pin
 * half a gigabyte - and a 157 MB key has already caused one out-of-memory
 * crash on a real device, in a process that also hosts a WebView. This
 * replaces those maps: one slot, keyed by whatever the proof system needs to
 * tell provers apart, reloaded on a miss and destroyed on a switch.
 *
 * [release] is for the host to call when the app leaves the foreground
 * (`onTrimMemory(TRIM_MEMORY_UI_HIDDEN)` on Android, which is what
 * `SirosWallet` wires up); a proof in progress finishes first and the
 * release happens when it ends.
 *
 * One residency is shared by every proof system in a
 * [ZkMdocPresentation], so the bound really is one prover, not one per
 * system. Proving is serialized on it as a consequence: two concurrent
 * proofs would otherwise each need a resident prover, and a wallet never
 * has two presentations in flight at once anyway.
