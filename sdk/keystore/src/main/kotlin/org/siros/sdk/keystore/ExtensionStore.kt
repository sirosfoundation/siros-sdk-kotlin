/**
 * Namespaced client-defined state in the synchronised container —
 * privatedata-spec §6.1 `S.extensions`.
 *
 * # Why this is an interface rather than three more methods on a keystore
 *
 * Two classes own a container: [JweKeystore] directly, and
 * [WscdKeystoreAdapter] through the [JweKeystore] it keeps for credentials
 * while the WSCD holds the signing keys. A caller that wants to store
 * extension state has one of them, does not know which, and must not care —
 * `setCredentialRefreshToken` is already reached by casting to each concrete
 * class in turn, which is one more call site to forget every time another
 * container owner appears.
 *
 * # The contract
 *
 * A namespace is a reverse-DNS string; an entry key MUST name a single
 * entity the wallet already tracks — a credential id, a kid, a batch id —
 * and MUST NOT name a subsystem or a plugin (§6.1.1). Resolution between two
 * devices is last-write-wins per entry, so an entry keyed by subsystem makes
 * one device's write discard the other's.
 *
 * Values are opaque strings, and that is the point: a client that has never
 * heard of a namespace can still carry it faithfully, which is what makes
 * staggered adoption across clients safe.
