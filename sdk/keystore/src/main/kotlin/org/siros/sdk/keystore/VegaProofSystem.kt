/**
 * [ZkProofSystem] implementation wrapping the `zk-cred-vega` native crate -
 * see `~/.claude/plans/zk-cred-vega-sdk-handoff.md` for the full
 * design/provenance history and current crate status.
 *
 * **Do not present this to a real relying party yet.** `zk-cred-vega` is
 * public and tagged (`v0.0.5` as of the nonce/public-IO circuit revision), and
 * its own expert security review is running in parallel with SDK-side
 * testing rather than gating it - but that review hasn't landed, so nothing
 * here should be trusted as a real trust anchor yet. This class is for
 * early-testing end-to-end use (own prover verified by own verifier, plus
 * real wallet <-> verifier interop against `sirosfoundation/vc`), same
 * caveat Longfellow shipped under before its own multipaz interop testing.
 * The `go-zk-circuits` catalog's `vega-mc-p256-v1-{prover,verifier}-key-r12`
 * entries are published for early testing ([zkCircuitClient] can fetch them
 * directly), carrying the same "PUBLISHED FOR EARLY TESTING ONLY" notice.
 * Every earlier revision (r2 through r11) has since been unpublished or
 * revoked - see the go-zk-circuits catalog's own notes for why each one
 * was retired.
 *
 * `buildWitness` is real (ECDSA witness from `issuerAuth`'s x5chain +
 * signature, MSO body from `issuerAuth`'s payload, fixed 4-slot claim
 * selection) - see its own doc comment for the slot-selection policy this
 * session settled on. Everything else (the `prep_prove`/`prove` FFI wiring,
 * fold-and-reuse state threading, pseudonym handling) mirrors
 * [LongfellowZkProofSystem]'s own shape.

     * (`Instant...truncatedTo(SECONDS)`), since an MSO's own timestamp
     * string isn't guaranteed to already be exactly 20 bytes.
     *
     * **Fixed-slot-count claim selection** (this session's own resolution
     * of what the handoff doc had left open): the circuit has EXACTLY
     * [MAX_CLAIMS_V1] claim slots, each bound to a genuine credential
     * element - no blank/padding slots. This requires the credential's
     * single disclosed namespace to have EXACTLY [MAX_CLAIMS_V1] elements
     * (a real v1 scope limit, not a bug - VEGA's circuit is sized for
     * small, fixed-shape credentials like the real 4-claim mDL test vector,
     * not arbitrarily large ones; a future circuit sized for a real mDL/PID/
     * photoID credential whose claim count vastly exceeds [MAX_CLAIMS_V1]
     * will need this to become "select the circuit's designated slot
     * claims out of a larger namespace" rather than "the whole namespace,
     * positionally" - not yet done, since no such circuit is deployed yet).
     * Slot assignment is the namespace's own document order (stable per
     * credential, independent of which claims a given presentation
     * discloses) - `disclose` only varies per slot based on membership in
     * [requestedClaims].
     *
     * **This does NOT make [ZkProofResult.nextState] reuse valid across
     * presentations disclosing a DIFFERENT subset of the same credential -
     * an earlier version of this comment claimed it did, and that claim was
     * never actually verified against the real crate.** Confirmed
     * empirically (flip every `disclose` flag between a `prep_prove` call
     * and the `prove()` call consuming its state, same claims otherwise):
     * the native call fails outright, the same "Step circuit N public
     * values changed between prep_prove and prove" class of error
     * `zk-cred-vega`'s own `fresh_nonce()` doc describes for a changed
     * nonce - `disclose` is baked into the step circuit's public values at
     * `prep_prove` time right alongside the nonce, not a free per-`prove()`
     * choice. [VegaProofCache] keys on the exact disclosed-claims SET for
     * exactly this reason; see its own doc comment.

     * Checks the catalog's own published `params` for this circuit against
     * what this class hardcodes (P-256, exactly [MAX_CLAIMS_V1] claim
     * slots) *before* spending a real download+decompress (a 100+MB
     * artifact) on a circuit this implementation can't actually use -
     * failing fast, locally, with a clear diagnostic naming the mismatch,
     * instead of discovering a circuit-shape change only via an opaque
     * native prove()/verify() failure much later. Doesn't yet check
     * `maxClaimBytes` against real witness byte lengths - unlike
     * `curve`/`numClaims`, a per-claim-byte-count mismatch surfaces at the
     * native layer with its own clear error already, since it's the
     * issuer's claim content (not a circuit-shape assumption this class
     * makes) that would be at fault.
     *
     * Only validates fields the catalog already publishes today
     * (`curve`, `numClaims` - confirmed via the real r12 manifest entry);
     * a `saltBytes` field doesn't exist there yet
     * (sirosfoundation/go-zk-circuits#29 tracks adding it - once it does,
     * this is the natural place to also validate a stored credential's
     * salt length against it, per siros-sdk-kotlin#243).
