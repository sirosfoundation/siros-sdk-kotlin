/**
 * Zero-knowledge presentation of a stored mdoc credential, with no wallet
 * and no Activity: resolve the verifier's requested proof systems against
 * what this device can prove, run the prover, and assemble the
 * `{version, status, zkDocuments: [...]}` DeviceResponse-shaped CBOR that
 * verifiers (multipaz's `DeviceResponseParser` among them) accept as a
 * `vp_token` entry.
 *
 * Everything here existed already - the registry, the circuit client, the
 * proof systems, [MdocDeviceResponseBuilder.buildZkDeviceResponse] - but was
 * assembled only inside a private method of the wallet facade, which needs
 * an Activity and a logged-in session to construct. A host that is not the
 * sample app (a wrapper app around a web wallet, say, whose credentials and
 * device keys live elsewhere) could reach the parts but not the whole, and
 * would have had to reimplement the document assembly. This is that whole,
 * in one place, taking exactly what a proof needs and nothing the wallet
 * happens to have.
 *
 * The device key never comes here. A proof that binds one asks for a
 * signature through [ZkWitnessSigner] and the caller signs with whatever
 * holds the key - the SDK keystore, a web page's keystore across a bridge,
 * a hardware token. A proof system without a device-binding concept (Vega)
 * never calls it, so callers must not require a key up front.
