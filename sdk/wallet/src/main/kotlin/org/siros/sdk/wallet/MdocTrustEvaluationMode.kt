/**
 * How an mdoc trust question is answered: by asking go-trust, by validating
 * against locally configured roots, or by asking go-trust with the local
 * roots as a fallback.
 *
 * The same choice applies to both mdoc trust registries, independently:
 * RICAL for readers ([SirosWallet.evaluateReaderTrust], ISO/IEC 18013-5
 * second edition Annex F) and VICAL for issuers
 * ([SirosWallet.evaluateIssuerTrust], Annex C).
 *
 * ## What the two paths actually are
 *
 * The **remote** path is an AuthZEN evaluation against go-trust, which is
 * the only path that honors a registry's temporary and dynamic trust roots -
 * go-trust's own cache and refresh handle freshness, so the wallet just asks
 * fresh each time. It also enforces RICAL `trustConstraints` and VICAL's
 * per-certificate `docType`.
 *
 * The **local** path is plain X.509 path validation against configured PEM
 * roots ([WalletConfig.readerTrustRootCertificatesPem] /
 * [WalletConfig.issuerTrustRootCertificatesPem]). It parses no RICAL/VICAL
 * CBOR and enforces none of those constraints. It exists for the stable,
 * known-in-advance official roots - it is deliberately not a
 * reimplementation of the registries, and it is the weaker of the two.
 *
 * Because local is weaker, which one runs is a security decision rather than
 * a performance one, which is why it is spelled out as a mode instead of
 * inferred.

     * backend was reachable and rejected us, not the trust question. Only a
