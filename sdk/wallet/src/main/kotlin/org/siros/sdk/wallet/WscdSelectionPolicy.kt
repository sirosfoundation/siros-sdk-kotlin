 * (`WalletConfig.availableKeystores`).
 *
 * **Phase 1 scope**: no changes to `siros-wscd-manager` (Rust/UniFFI) - no
 * live plugin enumeration, no live per-plugin capability query. Resolution
 * uses only [WscdPluginCapabilities]'s static table and picks among

 * handed to the SDK via `availableKeystores` - never by asking the SDK to
 * build or mutate a plugin instance itself (only the host app can wire up
 * the platform transports real plugins like fido2/r2ps need).
 *
 * Resolution order for [resolve]:
 * 1. `requiredTier == null` (credential type declared no requirement) ->
 *    `null` (no-op: caller keeps using its existing default keystore).
 * 2. A [WscdUserOverrideStore]-persisted per-(issuer, credentialType) user
 *    override that's still available and still meets `requiredTier` -> use
 *    it. Deliberate, explicit user state (set via [setUserOverride], e.g.
 *    from a settings screen) - NOT written to TOFU, since it's already its
 *    own stable, separately-tracked preference.
 * 3. Else a [WscdUserOverrideStore]-persisted *global* user override (every
 *    issuer/credential type, [setGlobalUserOverride]) that's still available
 *    and still sufficient -> use it.
 * 4. A [WscdTofuStore]-persisted choice for (issuer, credentialType) that's
 *    still available and still meets `requiredTier` -> reuse it.
 * 5. [defaultMapping]'s entry for (issuer, credentialType), if available and
 *    sufficient -> persist as the new TOFU entry, return it.
 * 6. Exactly one plugin among `availablePluginIds` meets `requiredTier` ->
 *    persist as TOFU, return it. Otherwise, if [currentDefaultPluginId] (the
 *    plugin already active before this resolution) is itself among
 *    `availablePluginIds` and meets `requiredTier`, prefer it - avoids an
 *    unnecessary plugin switch when the current default is already good
 *    enough, even though other eligible plugins exist.
 * 7. More than one eligible plugin and the current default isn't one of
 *    them (or is unknown) -> ask the host app via [requestChoice]. A
 *    `Chosen` result is used according to its `rememberScope` (see
 *    [RememberScope]: [RememberScope.ONCE] persists nothing,
 *    [RememberScope.THIS_ISSUER] persists as TOFU,
 *    [RememberScope.ALL_ISSUERS] persists as the new global user override).
 *    `Cancelled`, no [requestChoice] callback configured at all, or a
 *    `Chosen` answer outside the offered eligible list, all throw
 *    [AmbiguousWscdPluginException] - unlike steps 1-6, there is no safe
 *    "no-op" here: silently falling back to the default keystore when
 *    several sufficient plugins exist but none was picked would defeat this
 *    whole feature's purpose.
 * 8. Zero eligible plugins -> [NoEligibleWscdPluginException], a distinct
 *    signal from every other branch above so the caller does NOT silently
 *    proceed with an insufficient plugin.
