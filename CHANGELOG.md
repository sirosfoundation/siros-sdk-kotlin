# Changelog

All notable changes to the SIROS SDK for Android will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.18.0] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed
- **The self-driven re-login no longer reuses a cut-off token.**
  `AuthServerClient` caches access tokens independently of `AuthTokens`, so
  clearing the latter left the pre-cut-off token to be served from that cache
  and refused with `401` on first use. The re-login now calls the new
  `AuthServerClient.clearTokenCache()`, which drops cached tokens without
  ending the session the way `logout()` would.

### Added
- **Wallet instance lifecycle: the SDK now speaks the whole protocol**
  (SID-AUTH-06, go-wallet-backend#319). The backend grew a token cut-off, an
  erasure retry and a passkey-ownership check on top of the instance API the
  SDK already called; the client side of each of those is here.
  - `WalletState.LifecycleBlocked(reason, message, cachedAccounts)` - a
    blocked wallet is a state, not an error. Entered from `login()`,
    `unlockKeystore()`, `resumeSession()` and from the SDK's own re-login
    whenever the authorization server answers `403` with `WALLET_SUSPENDED`
    or `WALLET_REVOKED`. Neither reason discards anything local - see the
    correction under **Changed** for why `WALLET_REVOKED` is not proof the
    wallet was erased - and the state carries the backend's own message so
    the app can tell the user which case it is.
  - **One self-driven re-login after a token cut-off.** Any lifecycle change
    refuses every token issued before it, so the reauthentication signal now
    drops the tokens, API client and engine session and attempts `login()`
    exactly once - never in a loop. A lifecycle `403` there goes straight to
    `LifecycleBlocked`, a success continues as a normal login, anything else
    is the existing error path. `WalletEventListener.onReauthenticationRequired`
    still fires first for hosts that drive their own prompt.
  - A successful `setWalletInstanceStatus` write re-logs in the same way, so
    suspending *this* device's own instance lands in
    `LifecycleBlocked(SUSPENDED)` rather than surfacing later as a stray 401.
  - `409 ERASURE_INCOMPLETE` is retried per the protocol: five attempts, 1 s →
    8 s, identical body. A `401` after such a `409` is the acting token being
    dropped with the erased key material and counts as complete.
  - `403 CREDENTIAL_NOT_OWNED` at WIA generation retries the request once
    without `credential_id` and clears the stale id, with a warning. The first
    link recorded for an instance wins, so the SDK never guesses another one.
  - `WalletInstance.isThisDevice` and `SirosWallet.thisInstanceId` - the
    instance-key JWK thumbprint the SDK already sends as `wallet_instance_id`
    - so a Devices screen can mark this installation and warn before
    suspending it.
  - Optional `WalletEventListener.onWalletLifecycleBlocked(reason, message)`,
    with a no-op default.
  - **Security: the instance key now survives a logout.**
    `SessionStore.clearAccount()` deleted `instanceKeyId`, so the next login
    minted a new key and registered a **new, active** backend wallet instance.
    A *suspended* installation could therefore walk away from its own
    suspension simply by logging out and back in. Only `clearAll()` (a factory
    reset) drops it now.
  - A session generation makes the self-driven re-login happen once per
    *session* rather than once per call (late 401s from requests issued before
    the cut-off can no longer each start another), refuses it when there is no
    session left to replace, and aborts it when the caller logged out or
    destroyed the wallet while the old session was being torn down.
  - A lifecycle block tears the session down locally instead of calling
    `logout()`: the unawaited `DELETE /auth/session` could otherwise land
    after the retry the app makes once a suspended instance is reactivated,
    invalidating the session that retry had just established.

- **Sample app: a Devices screen and a blocked-wallet login screen.**
  Settings → Devices lists this account's wallet instances (this-device badge,
  status, key storage, last attested, reason) with per-row Suspend /
  Reactivate / Remove and a footer that deactivates the wallet behind a typed
  confirmation, reporting whether the backend confirmed the erasure. The login
  screen renders `WalletState.LifecycleBlocked` as its own screen - suspended
  explains and offers a retry, revoked explains and offers a fresh enrollment -
  instead of a generic error. Strings in `res/values*/strings.xml` and the
  Transifex source `assets/i18n/en.json`.

### Changed
- **Correction: `WALLET_REVOKED` no longer forgets the cached account.** The
  design assumed that code meant the wallet had been deactivated and erased.
  It does not: the backend returns it for the login gate of a *single* revoked
  instance too, and only deactivates the wallet when the **last** non-revoked
  instance is revoked - the user's other devices keep logging in either way,
  and only the human-readable `message` distinguishes the two. Forgetting the
  account on a per-instance revocation destroyed the other passkeys that still
  worked. Both refusal reasons now end the session, keep the cached account,
  and show the backend's own message; re-enrollment is the user's call.
  `deactivateWallet` is the one place that still forgets the account, where
  the caller asked for it and the outcome is unambiguous.
- **Source-breaking: `WalletState` has a new subclass.**
  `WalletState.LifecycleBlocked` means an exhaustive `when` over `WalletState`
  no longer compiles without a branch for it (the sample app needed one). Add
  a branch, or an `else`, when upgrading.
- **`SirosWallet.deactivateWallet` and `BackendApiClient.revokeAllWalletInstances`
  return `DeactivationOutcome(revoked, complete)`** instead of a bare count.
  The revocations stand even when the backend's erasure cascade did not
  finish, so the local account is forgotten either way and `complete` is what
  the app tells the user (an incomplete erasure leaves residual server-side
  data for an administrator to clean up).
- **`setWalletInstanceStatus` takes a typed `WalletInstanceStatus`** on both
  `SirosWallet` and `BackendApiClient`. The `status: String` overload is
  deprecated and kept for one release; it rejects a value the backend would
  refuse instead of sending it.
- `AuthException` carries the server's user-facing `serverMessage` separately
  from its developer-facing `message` - it is what tells a suspended wallet
  from a revoked one for the user. (Binary-incompatible for direct
  constructor callers; source-compatible.)

## [0.17.0] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed
- **A presentation the wallet cannot satisfy now fails immediately instead of
  stalling** (go-wallet-backend#335). The WMP transport's match handler
  ignored the verifier's DCQL query and answered with every stored
  credential, so a wallet holding an mDL and no PID claimed a full match set
  for a PID request; it now runs the same `CredentialMatcher` as the other
  transports. When nothing matches, the wallet sends the engine's
  `credentials_matched` action with an empty match set and a reason, which
  ends the flow at once with `NO_MATCHING_CREDENTIAL` naming the credential
  types the verifier asked for - instead of sitting at credential selection
  until the five-minute user-interaction timeout, or reporting a decline the
  user never made. Needs go-wallet-backend#336 on the engine side; against
  an older engine the extra action is ignored and behaviour is unchanged.
- `no_match_reason` is carried on the wire by both transports
  (`WalletEngineSession.sendMatchResponse` gained the parameter; the WMP
  profile dropped the field entirely).
- An issuance parked on `authorization_required` because it required a
  presentation that then failed this way is reported to the app as failed
  too, rather than silently waiting out its own timeout.

### Added
- `CredentialMatcher.requestedCredentialTypes` - the credential types a DCQL
  query asks for (`vct_values`/`doctype_value`), for explaining what is
  missing.
- `WalletEngineSession.sendCredentialsMatched`.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-09-17

### Changed
- `siros-wscd-manager` 0.8.1 -> 0.9.1: key ids minted by the softkey and
  FIDO2 plugins are now RFC 7638 JWK thumbprints (existing ids keep
  resolving); FIDO2 plugin state restored via `registerFido2PluginWithState`
  now rebinds its keys to the plugin, so they no longer fall through to the
  default plugin after a restart.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-09-16

First release whose native crate dependencies are all on Maven Central, so
`mavenCentral()` alone resolves the SDK; and the first to ship the bridge
capability vocabulary (`bridge-capabilities-0.15.0.{json,ts}` attached).

### Added
- **Bridge capability vocabulary** (`spec/bridge-capabilities.json`): the
  capability descriptor a web-view wrapper app advertises to the page it
  hosts, shaped like WMP's capability map. Generated into
  `org.siros.sdk.transport.bridge` (`BridgeCapabilityId`, one parameters
  class per capability, `BridgeDescriptor`, `BridgeDescriptorBuilder`), into
  Swift for siros-sdk-swift, and into TypeScript attached to each release
  for the frontend's bridge contract package. CI fails if the generated
  files drift from the spec. See `spec/README.md`.
- README: consuming the SDK now needs only `mavenCentral()` - the five native
  crate AARs are on Central as of 2026-09-10 (backfilled; their release
  workflows publish there on every tag).
- `docs/TWO-APIS.md`: the SDK's two entry points - the orchestrated API
  (`SirosWallet`) and the low-level, flow-free composition of keystore, auth
  and credentials for hosts that run the OID4VCI/OID4VP flows themselves -
  with the composition a web-view wrapper uses for native ZK proving and
  proximity, and what the low-level API deliberately leaves out.
- `.github/actions/central-publish`: signs and uploads one AAR + POM to the
  Central Portal, completing the POM with Central's required metadata and
  attaching sources/javadoc jars. For the SDK's native crate dependencies
  (siros-wscd-manager, siros-dc-matcher, zk-cred-*), which publish a
  hand-rolled POM rather than through Gradle; `central-backfill-native.yml`
  republishes already-released versions from GitHub Packages, so a consumer
  of the SDK needs only `mavenCentral()`.

### Changed
- Maven Central deployments publish automatically once validated
  (`publishingType = AUTOMATIC`); 0.14.0 was published by hand from the portal.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-09-10

First release published to **Maven Central** as `org.siros:siros-sdk-*` with
`org.siros:siros-sdk-bom` - the first public SDK release. Otherwise identical
to 0.13.0.

### Added
- Publication to **Maven Central** on each release tag, via the Central Portal
  publisher API (Nmcp): all eight modules plus the BOM as one signed
  deployment. Artifacts are signed with the SIROS Foundation SDK signing key
  (`1877CD169960F999CB7B138AB3BA2844F54BCB99`, on keyserver.ubuntu.com and
  keys.openpgp.org). Each artifact gains a `-javadoc` jar (a pointer to the
  Dokka reference; Central requires the file). GitHub Packages publication
  continues unchanged.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-09-10

First release published to Maven (GitHub Packages) as `org.siros:siros-sdk-*`
with `org.siros:siros-sdk-bom`. The 0.12.0 tag (2026-09-07) never rolled this
section, so some entries below shipped in 0.12.0 already; everything since
0.11.0 is here.

### Fixed
- `startIssuance(offerUri)` unpacks `credential_offer` / `credential_offer_uri`
  from any scheme (`haip-vci://`, an upper-cased scheme from a QR code, an
  issuer's `https://` redirect page), not only from `https://` - the engine
  itself only unpacks lowercase `openid-credential-offer://`, so a `haip-vci`
  link previously reached it as the raw offer. The decision is the new
  `resolveIssuanceStart`, shared with the offer-display lookup.

### Added
- Circuit lifecycle for ZK proving. `ZkCircuitClient` takes a `cacheDir`
  and keeps fetched artifacts on disk under their catalog-published SHA-256
  (verified on every read as well as every download), and descriptors
  network-first with the cached copy serving when every source fails - so a
  circuit is fetched and verified once per device and a proof works with no
  network. `ZkProverResidency` bounds the process to one loaded prover
  (Longfellow circuit or Vega prover key, 100+ MB of native memory each):
  `LongfellowZkProofSystem` and `VegaProofSystem` take one, `ZkMdocPresentation.standard`
  shares one between them, and `ZkMdocPresentation.releaseProvers()` drops
  it. `SirosWallet` wires the cache under the app's `cacheDir` and releases
  the prover on `TRIM_MEMORY_UI_HIDDEN` / `onLowMemory`; a proof in flight
  finishes first. Replaces the two unbounded per-system prover maps.
- `org.siros.sdk.keystore.ZkMdocPresentation`: zero-knowledge presentation
  of a stored mdoc credential with no wallet and no Activity - resolve the
  verifier's `zk_system_type` list against the registered proof systems,
  run the prover, and assemble the `zkDocuments` DeviceResponse CBOR. Takes
  credential bytes, a session transcript, requested claims, an optional
  verifier identity and a `ZkWitnessSigner`; the device key never enters
  it. `SirosWallet.zkPresentation` exposes the wallet's instance, and both of
  the wallet's ZK paths (DC API and `sign_presentation`) now go through it.
  The assembly used to be a private method of `SirosWallet`.
- Public-API dumps (`sdk/<module>/api/<module>.api`, Kotlin
  binary-compatibility-validator) for every published module, checked by
  `apiCheck` in CI. An intended signature change is recorded with `apiDump`
  and reviewed as a diff.
- Maven publication. Every `:sdk:` module publishes `org.siros:siros-sdk-<module>`
  (AAR, sources, POM with BSD-2-Clause/scm metadata, Gradle module metadata)
  plus `org.siros:siros-sdk-bom`, to GitHub Packages on each release tag;
  `publishToMavenLocal` works for local consumers. The version is
  `sdkVersion` in `gradle.properties`, overridden from the tag in CI. The
  release workflow's publish step used to be a no-op (`|| echo skipping`)
  and now fails loudly instead.
- The platform components a host app needs for DC API and NFC engagement now
  ship in the SDK and are merged into the app manifest automatically:
  `org.siros.sdk.wallet.dcapi.DCAPIGetCredentialActivity` (the Digital
  Credentials API `GET_CREDENTIAL` entry point, translucent theme
  `Theme.SirosSdk.DcApiHost`, GPM privileged-app allowlist) and
  `org.siros.sdk.keystore.mdoc.MdocHostApduService` (ISO 18013-5 §9.2.1 NFC
  static handover, with its `host-apdu-service` descriptor). A host app
  keeps `WalletSessionHolder` pointed at its unlocked wallet and sets
  `ActiveEngagement.handoverSelectBytes` while an engagement is shown, and
  declares nothing else. Both were previously sample-app code every
  integrator would have had to copy.
- `org.siros.sdk.keystore.OkHttpR2psTransport`, the default
  `R2psTransportProvider`, moved into the SDK from the sample app (Swift
  counterpart: `URLSessionR2psTransport`).
- Wallet instance lifecycle (SID-AUTH-06, go-wallet-backend#319):
  `SirosWallet.listWalletInstances()`, `setWalletInstanceStatus()` and
  `deactivateWallet()` (revokes every instance server-side, then forgets the
  local account), backed by the new `WalletInstance` type and
  `BackendApiClient` methods. WIA generation now sends the logged-in passkey's
  `credential_id` so the backend can link the instance to the passkey.
  `AuthException.errorCode` now carries the AS's error code, so a 403
  `WALLET_SUSPENDED` / `WALLET_REVOKED` login refusal is distinguishable
  from a plain authentication failure.

- Answer the engine's `sign_client_auth` sign request (go-wallet-backend#317,
  wallet-frontend#282) on both the legacy engine transport and WMP: sign the
  RFC 9449 DPoP proof and a fresh OAuth client attestation PoP for each
  request with the instance key - the same key the Wallet Instance
  Attestation binds as `cnf` - and report it as `dpop_key_id`, so the
  DPoP-bound token is bound to the attested key and no PoP is ever replayed.
  `KeystoreManager.generateDPoPProof` is the new keystore primitive
  (`JweKeystore` and `WscdKeystoreAdapter` implement it). `dpop_key_id` from
  `flow_complete` is persisted with the refresh token
  (`CredentialRefreshTokenEntry.dpopKeyId`) and presented back on renewal.
  The WMP sign sub-flow also answers `request_attestation` now. Requires a
  backend with go-wallet-backend#318; older backends never send the action.

### Changed
- `WalletSessionHolder` moved from the sample app to
  `org.siros.sdk.wallet.dcapi`; `ActiveEngagement` to
  `org.siros.sdk.keystore.mdoc`. The SDK's own strings are prefixed `siros_`
  and can be overridden by a host app by name.

## [0.11.0]

Highlights since v0.10.0 (1 commit). Sample app: versionName 0.11.0, versionCode 11.

### Fixed
- NFC static handover: send the mandatory "Complete List of 128-bit Service
  UUIDs" AD (type `0x07`) in little-endian byte order, sending only the
  single UUID matching the LE-Role-preferred mode - a real reader rejected
  a 2-UUID AD outright and otherwise saw no UUIDs at all in our handover
  message (#147)
- BLE central-client mode: restart the scan window at the moment a real NFC
  tap actually completes handover, instead of trusting a window that
  started when the presentation screen mounted - the first scan attempt
  reliably timed out before a real tap completed (#147)
- BLE central-client/peripheral-server: distinguish a peer's own
  session-termination status from an unexpected data-carrying message once
  the session is already established, replying only in the latter case
  (#147)
- BLE central-client mode: add a grace delay before signaling end-of-transfer
  after the final response chunk - sending it immediately raced a real
  reader's background verification thread (#147)

## [0.10.0]

Highlights since v0.9.0 (1 commit). Sample app: versionName 0.10.0, versionCode 10.

### Fixed
- Register `mdoc-openid4vp://` (ISO 18013-7 Annex B's mdoc-specific OpenID4VP
  scheme) in the manifest's intent-filter and `DeepLinkClassifier` - a link
  using this scheme was silently dropped as `Unknown` before reaching the
  app at all, since Android has no intent-filter to route it through
  (#145)

## [0.9.0]

Highlights since v0.8.0 (16 commits). Sample app: versionName 0.9.0, versionCode 9.

### Added
- DC API/OpenID4VP: run the shared DCQL matching engine alongside the built-in
  matcher, then let it decide which credentials actually qualify (#138, #140)
- Delete button next to Renew on fully-exhausted ("shadow") credential cards -
  previously the only way to remove one was renewing it first
- Wired RICAL reader-trust controls into the in-session Settings tab (#129)

### Fixed
- BLE peripheral-server mode: fixed a permanent-hang bug where a stale session
  from a prior connection attempt silently swallowed every retry with no
  response and no completion callback, leaving the presentation screen stuck
  indefinitely - added a bounded overall timeout and an explicit session-
  termination status instead of silently dropping late messages (#143)
- BLE: both roles now report failure when their own connection attempt never
  completes, instead of hanging forever waiting for the other role (#135, #137)
- `eligibleInstances` (and the credential-list "shadow" display state) now
  also checks signing-key availability, not just consumption count, so a
  credential with a lost key can no longer masquerade as usable (#139)
- A `null` `kid` on a stored credential no longer silently masks a lost key
  binding (#142)
- The default ("softkey") WSCD plugin's private keys now correctly survive an
  app restart - a JSON-shape mismatch at the Rust/Kotlin FFI boundary
  (`UniFFISigner.exportPrivateKeypairs()`) was silently dropping every
  generated key before it ever reached persisted storage, making any
  softkey-issued credential look "shadow" (no available key) after the very
  next cold start
- A property-ordering bug (`fido2RegisteredTransport` read before its own
  declaration during `wallet`'s eager construction) silently degraded FIDO2
  plugin registration to a stateless instance every cold start
- `SessionStore.privateDataJwe` now persists with a blocking, durable write
  instead of `SharedPreferences.apply()`'s async flush, closing a window
  where a hard-kill shortly after credential issuance could lose the
  just-written encrypted key container
- Engine WebSocket: disconnect a prior session before reconnecting, instead of
  leaking a duplicate concurrent client (#141)
- DC API/OpenID4VP x5c trust checks now have a local-anchor fallback path
  (#132), and a decline now returns a real structured OpenID4VP error
  response instead of an opaque exception (#130)
- Fail closed on an explicit trust-evaluation denial rather than falling back
  to local validation (#127)
- CI: trigger the Play Store upload from the tag, not `release: published`
  (#128)

### Changed
- DC API registration now lives in the SDK, on our own matcher (Phase 6, #131)
- Target API 36 (Android 16) (#134)

## [0.8.0]

Highlights since v0.7.0 (12 commits). Sample app: versionName 0.8.0, versionCode 8.

### Added
- `VegaProofSystem`: real Vega ZK mdoc proving, end-to-end tested against a live
  verifier on device (#116)
- `BbsProofSystem`: the blind BBS presentation path (#117), plus the wallet's half
  of blind BBS issuance (#123)
- Our own DC API credential matcher, Phase 1, behind the `-PcustomDcMatcher` build
  flag (#118)
- VICAL-based issuer-trust evaluation for mdoc presentation (#114)
- Sample app: a "Computing proof…" indicator during Vega ZK proof generation, so the
  multi-second prove step is no longer a silent freeze (#124)
- `prepProve`/`prove` timing logs for ZK proof generation (#119)

### Changed
- `ZkProofSystem` generalized beyond mdoc-only, so non-mdoc credential formats can
  plug into the same proving interface (#115)
- `zk-cred-vega` bumped to 0.0.5 (r12 circuit revision) (#119, #125)
- Sample app requests `largeHeap`, which the Vega prover-key decompression needs (#120)

### Fixed
- Circuit decompression no longer double-buffers the decompressed artifact, roughly
  halving peak memory for both Vega and Longfellow (#122)
- AndroidSVG full-bleed `<image>` dark-band mis-render in credential logo previews (#121)
- BLE session-establishment callback race during proximity presentation (#114)
- Blank logo square for SVG credential logos (#114)

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial SDK with 7 modules: transport, auth, keystore, flow, credentials, wallet, passkey-provider
- Sample app demonstrating registration, login, issuance, and presentation flows
- CI pipeline with build, test, and coverage gate (25%)
- CONTRIBUTING.md and ARCHITECTURE.md

### Fixed
- WmpSessionException and WmpTimeoutException now extend SirosException
- Redacted credential IDs and session UUIDs from log output
